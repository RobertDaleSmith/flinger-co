                    Our (Flinger.co's) vision is to empower anybody to curate and control their own cloud-based TV channel from the devices they use most often while watching TV.

                <div class="blog_post_title">Our Story</div>
                <div class="blog_post_body">
                    We are a startup born in a dorm. It all started about a year ago when our founder, Robert received a Google TV device from a developer contest. 
                    This being his first smart TV he thought it would be a great way to watch web content on his TV. Although, he found himself 
                    still watching web content on his laptop because it was just so tedious to find and navigate to online video through the TV.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on this frustration, he built this really great browser extension called <a href="http://chromemote.com/" target="_blank">Chromemote</a>, 
                    which allows you to completely control any Google TV from any laptop running Google Chrome. Chromemote enables complete control of the TV and 
                    makes it super easy to send YouTube videos or anything with a URL to your TV.
                    <br><br>
                    Google liked the idea so much that a couple of their Google TV developers built a special <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-tv-chrome-extensions/" target="_blank">plugin</a> 
                    for Chrome that enables Chromemote to work the way it does. After successfully pitching the idea at 
                    <a href="http://3daystartup.org/companies-founded-by-3ds-alumni/" target="_blank">3 Day Startup</a>, we launched Chromemote and it really took off within the Google TV community.
                    <br><br>
                    This past semester we were one of six teams selected to participate in the University of Houston's startup accelerator <a href="http://redlabs.bauer.uh.edu/" target="_blank">Red Labs</a>. 
                    Along with Red Labs, we also were accepted into the Microsoft Imagine Cup Student Accelerator. In March we were selected as one of the top fifteen teams in the US, and Microsoft 
                    flew us out to Silicon Valley for an intense week long <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815004055/http://icsocialmediateam.com/2013/04/09/the-us-imagine-cup-startup-bootcamp-five-days-of-knowledge-experience-and-fun/" target="_blank">startup bootcamp</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    Over that week in Silicon Valley, Microsoft really pushed us to scale our idea to a much larger audience than only Google TVs. So we built Flinger.co, an entirely new platform that brings 
                    the best features of Chromemote to just about any TV and beyond just the Google TV platform.

                    <br><br>
                    We are a developer and designer obessed with entrepreneurship, startups, and building cutting edge second screen experiences that redefine television interaction.

                <div class="blog_post_title">How it Works</div>
                <div class="blog_post_body">
                    Flinger.co is a web app that enables interaction between just about any connected TV that has a web browser and a laptop, tablet, or smart phone. Simply create a new channel on the big screen 
                    at Flinger.co. Then use the unique six digit code to pair to this channel from any second screen device. 
                    <br><br>
                    We have created a variety of Flinger.co Remote apps to enable you to control your
                    channel from whatever device you have in-hand while watching TV. Don't have a smart TV? ..no problem because you can use any PC/Mac with a browser to run the Flinger.co viewer from.
                    <br><br>
                    Not only can an unlimited number of remotes connect to a single channel, but also an unlimited number of viewers can connect to a single channel. Simply invite friends to watch with you using the
                    unique url matching your six digit Flinger channel code. Also chat with friends and see the conversation overlay the video on-screen using the Flinger.co Remote.
